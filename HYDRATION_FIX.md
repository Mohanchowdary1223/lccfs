# HTML Hydration Error Fix

## Problem
React was throwing a hydration error: "In HTML, `<div>` cannot be a descendant of `<p>`". This occurred because the `AlertDialogDescription` component renders as a `<p>` element, but we had `<div>` elements nested inside it.

## Root Cause
The issue was in several AlertDialog components where complex content (containing `<div>` elements) was placed inside `AlertDialogDescription` components, which render as `<p>` elements. This violates HTML semantics where block-level elements like `<div>` cannot be children of inline elements like `<p>`.

## Files Fixed

### 1. `src/app/admin/users/page.tsx`
Fixed 3 AlertDialog instances:
- **Block User Dialog**: Moved user details div outside AlertDialogDescription
- **Unblock User Dialog**: Moved user details div outside AlertDialogDescription  
- **Deactivate User Dialog**: Moved user details and warning div outside AlertDialogDescription

### 2. `src/components/profile/ActivityTab.tsx`
Fixed 1 AlertDialog instance:
- **Delete Chat Dialog**: Moved chat details div outside AlertDialogDescription

## Solution Pattern
Changed from:
```tsx
<AlertDialogDescription>
  Text content...
  {condition && (
    <div>Complex content...</div>
  )}
</AlertDialogDescription>
```

To:
```tsx
<AlertDialogDescription>
  Text content...
</AlertDialogDescription>
{condition && (
  <div>Complex content...</div>
)}
```

## Result
- ✅ Hydration errors resolved
- ✅ Proper HTML semantics maintained
- ✅ Visual layout preserved
- ✅ Functionality unchanged
- ✅ All components compile without errors

## Prevention
When using AlertDialogDescription (or any component that renders as `<p>`):
- Keep content simple text only
- Move any `<div>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, or other block elements outside
- Place complex content as siblings within the AlertDialogHeader or AlertDialogContent

This ensures proper HTML structure and prevents hydration mismatches between server and client rendering.
