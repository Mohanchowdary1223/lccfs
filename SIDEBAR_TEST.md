# Sidebar Test Results

## What I've Fixed:

### 1. Desktop Sidebar Header
- **Issue**: Header showing both title and trigger button in a messy layout
- **Fix**: Conditional rendering based on sidebar state:
  - When **expanded**: Shows "Legal Chat" title + trigger button (right-aligned)  
  - When **collapsed**: Shows only centered trigger button

### 2. Button Styling in Collapsed Mode
- **Issue**: Buttons not properly centered when sidebar is collapsed
- **Fix**: Added responsive classes:
  - `justify-start group-data-[collapsible=icon]:justify-center` - Centers icons when collapsed
  - `group-data-[collapsible=icon]:sr-only` - Hides text when collapsed
  - Different hover effects for expanded vs collapsed states

### 3. Visual Improvements
- Added background to header (`bg-muted/20`)
- Improved spacing (`p-3` instead of `p-2`)
- Added proper transitions and animations
- Enhanced chat history cards with better spacing and `bg-card`

### 4. Main Content Area
- Improved border handling for better visual separation
- Fixed positioning logic to work smoothly with sidebar states

## Current State:
✅ Mobile sidebar works with floating trigger button
✅ Desktop sidebar has proper collapsed/expanded states  
✅ Smooth transitions between states
✅ Better visual hierarchy and spacing
✅ Proper icon centering in collapsed mode

## To Test:
1. Open http://localhost:3000/user/chatbot
2. Click the trigger button to collapse/expand sidebar
3. Check that icons are centered when collapsed
4. Verify smooth transitions
5. Test on mobile (should show trigger button in top-left)
